# JSON

This is a full tutorial how to build a complete parser, in this case JSON as it is simple but covers
everything except reursion this API is able to do.

## Preparation

We need the official JSON syntax, which is found [here](http://json.org)

And as we will need a bit of advanced regex (dont worry i will do it for you) we will need the
tool https://regexr.com

Then we will need to decide what our parser should produce, the 2 most common ways are ->
deserialisation or flexible model

### Deserialisation

Means that we have POJOs and we are shure the JSON follows the structure of the POJO and fill an
instance of it with the JSON values via reflections. This is very very usefull and every
professional Parser has such a feature but it is very time consuming and an extreme overkill for an
tutorial

### Flexible Model

In this approach we create Classes like JsonArray JsonObject JsonValue and so on which are filled
with flexible structures like HashMaps or Lists, means that we can fill this lists and maps up with
everything we like to. This causes much of Casting and instanceof later on but is simple to realize
at the parsing stage
> So we would clearly use the **Flexible Model**

Now we need to find the information how the model works. I will not explain this detailed as this
are very trivial steps. Simply create Classes that represent all the elements which may ocour in a
JSON. This is the Structure i will use:

- `Json` (Top level container)
- `String` (sub of `Value`)
- `Number` (sub of `Value`)
- `Value`  (marking interface)
- `Member`
- `Array` (sub of `Value`, sub of `Element`)
- `Object` (sub of `Value`, sub of `Element`)
- `Element` (marking interface)

depending on how you design your Parser you may also create

- `True` (sub of `Value`)
- `False` (sub of `Value`)
- `Null` (sub of `Value`)
- `Members` (collection of `Member`s, used within Object)
- `Elements` (collection of `Element`s, used within Array)

We won't do it in here for time reasons but normally you would make this extra step of abstraction
> We are done with the preparation!

## Grammar File

Now we create the main part of the Parser,
the [Grammar File](https://github.com/nbrugger-tgm/JainParse/blob/master/GrammarFiles.md)

### Adding Tokens

There are a few basic tokens nearly every parser will need.

```js
    LINE_END_WIN='\r\n'
	LINE_END_UNIX='\n'
	LINE_END_OSX='\r'
	CHRACTERS='[A-Za-z]+'
	UNDERSCORE='_'
	EQUAL='[=]'
	WHITESPACE='[ \t]+'
	SLASH='\/'
	COMMA=','
	COLON=':'
	POINT='\.'
	EOF='\Z'
```

> Do **NOT**, use the `$` and `^` regex as they do not capture the \r or \n which is very neccesarry for my Parser to work!

> Also do not create Tokens which are overlapping (eg. `TOK1='[A-Za-züöäß]+'` `NAME='[A-Z][a-z]+'`) and define them as simple as possible

> At least avoid to allready specify the chars to a specific role in the parser except the char is really only used for one purpose like `[` as `START_OBJECT`

> Now a thig you are allowed to: Commenting! it is done with // between Token or grammar definers

At the next step we need to take care about Json String escaping which also needs to be done by the
parser. Means that `\"` , `"` and ```\``` all will have seperate tokens which do not overlap. This
is a bit complicated and you need to be familliar with the glory hell of regex so here is the string
escaping "code".

```js

```

basicly it is adding `(?<!\\)` before the unescaped varant. There are some cases where it is a bit
more complicated
